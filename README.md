# TextCrawlers
This was made to be an online school project (something I worked on while in shcool, but not doing classwork).
 I recently decided to try developing on the concept of moving a charcter through a dungeon with only text.
 At the time of writing the project is in Alpha.0.1.
 Currently no road map is in place.
 Development is slow.
 I am working with Python and my code is awful.
 Thanks for checking it out!
